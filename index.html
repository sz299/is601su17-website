    <h1>Short Biography</h1>
     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>Hello everyone!My name is Sarwat Zareen. I have graduated from City University of New York with a major in
     Accounting and a minor in Business Law. I finished my CPA exam and currently working with a CPA firm in
     Midtown, New York. I am fairly new to html and CSS styling and excited to have this chance to learn during this semester.</p>

     <h3>Academic Goals</h3>
     <p>Besides my interest in business analytics, another reason for me to pursue further in my studies is to
     obtain sufficent credits to get my CPA license. Since I have already earned enough Accounting credits, I want
     to complete my additional requirements by taking business analytics classes. This will help me to advance
     opportunities in other sectors not just audit. My academic goals include completing masters in information
     systems at NJIT as well as obtaining my license at its earliest.</p>

     <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
     <p>Taking classes on databases and SAP will enhance my opportuities in consulting or ERP system
     implementations. Working with a number of clients currently, I figure that having a background in accounting
     and information systems can give me a better understanding of the client's business and accounting processes. I
     am looking forward to advance my career by working as a business consultant at a firm like Big 4. </h3>
